By identifying, selecting, and evaluating relevant literature, a literature review helps to establish the context of a research topic and to identify gaps in the existing body of knowledge.</p><h6>What is Literature?</h6><p>When we talk about literature, we are referring to the works that researchers consult to understand and investigate a particular field. This can include academic books, professional journals, conference proceedings, theses, research reports, and electronic databases. Literature reviews are also useful for identifying other works by the same researchers, which can help to build a more comprehensive understanding of a particular research topic.</p><h6>The Benefits of a Literature Review</h6><p>A good literature review can help to answer important questions about a research topic, such as why it is necessary to study a particular problem and what assumptions need to be tested. By providing a historical context for a research topic, a literature review can also help to establish the importance of a particular problem and identify gaps in existing research. Furthermore, by summarizing and integrating individual findings, a literature review can help to address broader, integrative questions about a particular topic.</p><h6>Steps for Conducting a Literature Review</h6><p>There are several key steps involved in conducting a literature review:</p><ol><li><p class="dropcap">Scoping: This involves familiarizing oneself with the literature, identifying research questions, and identifying important contributions to scientific knowledge.</p></li><li><p class="dropcap">Planning: Once research questions have been identified, the search criteria are established. This includes considerations such as terminology, research design, target audience, and time frame.</p></li><li><p class="dropcap">Searching: Databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, arXiv, Web of Science, Research Rabbit, and Connected Papers are used to find papers related to the research field.</p></li><li><p class="dropcap">Screening: A bibliographic manager, such as Zotero, is used to keep track of references and citation managers. Files and directories are named using appropriate naming conventions, such as using an underscore to separate the year of publication, authors, and title.</p></li><li><p class="dropcap">Eligibility: Relationships with other published works are established, and the validity of assumptions and the contribution of the articles are considered.</p></li></ol><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Therefore, literature reviews are an essential component of any research project. By providing an overview of the existing state of knowledge in a particular field, literature reviews help to establish the context of a research topic, identify gaps in existing research, and address broader, integrative questions about a particular topic. By following the steps outlined above, researchers can ensure that their literature reviews are comprehensive, rigorous, and useful for building knowledge in their chosen field.</span></p><hr><p>Basic steps I followed for the literature review of my project:</p><p>1. Finding papers</p><p>Using the bibliographic databases available at the university (Web of Science, Scopus, etc.), I started my first approach to the topic of machine learning applications and their uses in fields such as differential equations, neural networks, and computational mechanics. To do this, it is crucial to use a search equation and refine/filter the results according to one's particular interest. Another very good option is to use connectedpapers.com, whose tool allows you to find the similarity between scientific publications related to an entry paper.</p><p>At this step, it is very helpful to review review-type scientific articles.</p><p>2. Storing papers</p><p>In this step, it is crucial to have a repository where you can store all the papers you are reading and have version control available. Zotero is an incredible tool because, in addition to being open-source, it allows you to export references in a .bib file and synchronize it with other software such as Mendeley. Additionally, it allows you to take notes and annotations on the paper itself.</p><p>3. Reading the paper</p><p>I recommend reading "How to Read a Paper" from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, 2016 (available at <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf">https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf</a>)</p><p>The publication "How to Read a Paper" provides a practical guide to help readers understand and analyze scientific articles. The article suggests a number of steps to be followed when reading a paper, including identifying the research problem, reviewing the relevant literature, evaluating the methodology used, interpreting the results, and critically evaluating the work.</p><p>Additionally, the publication provides useful tips for maximizing reading efficiency, such as active reading, note-taking, defining vocabulary, and using additional sources to complement understanding of the topic. The importance of clear and effective communication in papers is highlighted, and authors are suggested to follow certain writing guidelines to ensure their work is accessible and understandable to readers.</p><p>Overall, the publication offers a complete set of tools and strategies to help readers navigate scientific papers and better understand the research presented.</p><p>4. Writing down the main ideas of the paper:</p><p>Create notes, questions, try to prioritize the ideas presented in the text. What is the big picture? And finally, how can said paper contribute to the literature review you are conducting?</p><hr><h1>Software for Literature Review</h1><p>Here are some useful software for doing literature review that I have used in my research:</p><ol><li><p>Zotero: Zotero is a free and open-source reference management software that allows you to collect, organize, and share research sources. It is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux, and integrates with various web browsers. One of its benefits is that it allows you to easily add references to your library and automatically generates citations and bibliographies.</p></li><li><p>Mendeley: Mendeley is another reference management software that allows you to organize and cite sources, and collaborate with others. It has a user-friendly interface, and you can easily import PDFs, annotate them, and generate citations and bibliographies. It also has a social networking feature, allowing you to discover and connect with other researchers.</p></li><li><p>ConnectedPapers.com: is a web-based tool designed to help researchers explore and navigate the academic literature. The tool works by leveraging citation data to create a visual network of related papers, which allows users to identify and explore papers that are semantically similar to their research interests.</p><p>The benefits of using ConnectedPapers.com include its ability to help users discover papers they might have otherwise missed, its ability to help users identify the most important and influential papers on a given topic, and its ability to help users explore new research areas and identify potential collaborations. The tool is also free to use and does not require any downloads or installations, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</p></li><li><p>ResearchRabbit: ResearchRabbit is a free web-based software that assists researchers with organizing and managing their literature review process. The software allows users to create and organize their own personal library of research papers, as well as annotate and highlight sections of papers directly within the platform. Additionally, ResearchRabbit can automatically extract citation information from PDF files, saving time and reducing the likelihood of error.</p></li><li><p>Rayyan: Rayyan is a web and mobile app designed to help researchers and students with systematic reviews and literature reviews. It allows users to import and screen large volumes of literature, and collaboratively work with others to identify relevant studies. The platform offers features like exclusion/inclusion criteria, tagging, and the ability to export references to other software. Rayyan also has a machine learning-based classifier that helps predict which studies are relevant and which are not, making the screening process faster and more efficient. Overall, Rayyan is a useful tool for those involved in literature reviews, systematic reviews, and other types of research that require large amounts of literature to be reviewed and organized.</p></li></ol></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 28, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://jmmachadol.github.io/blog_ml-pde/tags/tools/">Review</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://jmmachadol.github.io/blog_ml-pde/authors/jose-manuel-machado-loaiza/" rel="author">Jose Manuel Machado-Loaiza</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://jmmachadol.github.io/blog_ml-pde/literature-review-physics-informed-machine-learning.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Literature review: Physics-Informed Machine Learning </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://jmmachadol.github.io/blog_ml-pde/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-02-17T09:15" class="feed__date">February 17, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://jmmachadol.github.io/blog_ml-pde/literature-review-physics-informed-machine-learning.html">Literature review: Physics-Informed Machine Learning</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_config = function () {
