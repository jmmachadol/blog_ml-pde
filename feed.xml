                <h1>Literature Review: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</h1>
<p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is an area of research that combines neural networks with physical principles to create more accurate and efficient predictive models. The PINNs approach has been applied to a range of fields, including fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, material science, geophysics, astrophysics, quantum physics, and machine learning itself.</p>
<p>The main advantage of PINNs is that they can improve the accuracy of neural network models by incorporating prior knowledge of the underlying physics. This can help to overcome the limitations of traditional data-driven methods, which may struggle to account for physical laws and constraints.</p>
<p>Research has shown that PINNs can be effective in a wide range of applications. In fluid dynamics, PINNs has been used to predict the behavior of complex fluid flows, such as turbulent flows, with greater accuracy than traditional computational fluid dynamics methods. PINNs has also been used to design more efficient wind turbines and optimize the shape of aircraft wings.</p>
<p>In solid mechanics, PINNs has been used to predict the deformation and failure of materials under different loading conditions, such as the behavior of soft materials under compression. PINNs has also been applied in material science to predict the properties of novel materials with potential applications in fields such as energy storage and conversion.</p>
<p>In geophysics, PINNs has been used to model the behavior of seismic waves and to predict the occurrence and magnitude of earthquakes. In astrophysics, PINNs has been used to study the evolution of galaxies and the behavior of dark matter. In quantum physics, PINNs has been used to simulate quantum systems with a large number of interacting particles.</p>
<p>PINNs have also been applied to other areas of physics such as plasma physics, optical physics, acoustics, and thermal transport. For example, in plasma physics, PINNs have been used to predict the behavior of plasma instabilities in fusion reactors. In optical physics, PINNs have been used to design novel optical devices with specific functionalities. In acoustics, PINNs have been used to predict the sound field and the propagation of sound waves in complex geometries. In thermal transport, PINNs have been used to design more efficient heat exchangers and predict the temperature distribution in electronic devices.</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of PINNs, there are also challenges associated with their implementation. One of the main challenges is choosing the structure of the neural network model and ensuring that it is compatible with the underlying physics. Another challenge is obtaining high-quality training data that captures the relevant physical processes. Additionally, the interpretability and robustness of PINN models need further research.</p>
<p>Overall, the literature suggests that PINNs is a promising research area that has the potential to revolutionize many fields of science and engineering. Further research is needed to refine PINNs techniques and to investigate their full potential in a wide range of applications.</p>
<h2>Relation of PINNs with Computational Mechanics</h2>
<p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a natural extension of classical computational mechanics methods and are closely related to the field of computational mechanics. Computational mechanics is a discipline that uses mathematical modeling and numerical analysis techniques to solve problems in mechanics, including fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and structural mechanics.</p>
<p>The development of PINNs is driven by the need to overcome some of the limitations of traditional computational mechanics methods, which can be computationally expensive and require a large amount of training data to be accurate. PINNs address these limitations by incorporating prior knowledge of the underlying physical principles into the neural network architecture, allowing for more efficient and accurate predictions of mechanical systems.</p>
<p>PINNs have been used in solid mechanics to predict the deformation and failure of materials under different loading conditions, such as the behavior of soft materials under compression. In addition, PINNs have been used to simulate the dynamics of fluids, such as turbulent flows, which are notoriously difficult to model using traditional computational fluid dynamics methods.</p>
<p>The relationship between PINNs and computational mechanics is mutually beneficial. While PINNs can provide more accurate and efficient predictions, computational mechanics can provide the necessary physical principles and constraints to guide the development of PINN models. As a result, PINNs have the potential to greatly enhance the predictive capabilities of computational mechanics methods in a wide range of fields.</p>

                <p>A literature review is an essential component of any research project, as it provides an overview of the current state of knowledge in a particular field. By identifying, selecting, and evaluating relevant literature, a literature review helps to establish the context of a research topic and to identify gaps in the existing body of knowledge.</p>
<h6>What is Literature?</h6>
<p>When we talk about literature, we are referring to the works that researchers consult to understand and investigate a particular field. This can include academic books, professional journals, conference proceedings, theses, research reports, and electronic databases. Literature reviews are also useful for identifying other works by the same researchers, which can help to build a more comprehensive understanding of a particular research topic.</p>
<h6>The Benefits of a Literature Review</h6>
<p>A good literature review can help to answer important questions about a research topic, such as why it is necessary to study a particular problem and what assumptions need to be tested. By providing a historical context for a research topic, a literature review can also help to establish the importance of a particular problem and identify gaps in existing research. Furthermore, by summarizing and integrating individual findings, a literature review can help to address broader, integrative questions about a particular topic.</p>
<h6>Steps for Conducting a Literature Review</h6>
<p>There are several key steps involved in conducting a literature review:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="dropcap">Scoping: This involves familiarizing oneself with the literature, identifying research questions, and identifying important contributions to scientific knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="dropcap">Planning: Once research questions have been identified, the search criteria are established. This includes considerations such as terminology, research design, target audience, and time frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="dropcap">Searching: Databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, arXiv, Web of Science, Research Rabbit, and Connected Papers are used to find papers related to the research field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="dropcap">Screening: A bibliographic manager, such as Zotero, is used to keep track of references and citation managers. Files and directories are named using appropriate naming conventions, such as using an underscore to separate the year of publication, authors, and title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="dropcap">Eligibility: Relationships with other published works are established, and the validity of assumptions and the contribution of the articles are considered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Therefore, literature reviews are an essential component of any research project. By providing an overview of the existing state of knowledge in a particular field, literature reviews help to establish the context of a research topic, identify gaps in existing research, and address broader, integrative questions about a particular topic. By following the steps outlined above, researchers can ensure that their literature reviews are comprehensive, rigorous, and useful for building knowledge in their chosen field.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Basic steps I followed for the literature review of my project:</p>
<p>1. Finding papers</p>
<p>Using the bibliographic databases available at the university (Web of Science, Scopus, etc.), I started my first approach to the topic of machine learning applications and their uses in fields such as differential equations, neural networks, and computational mechanics. To do this, it is crucial to use a search equation and refine/filter the results according to one's particular interest. Another very good option is to use connectedpapers.com, whose tool allows you to find the similarity between scientific publications related to an entry paper.</p>
<p>At this step, it is very helpful to review review-type scientific articles.</p>
<p>2. Storing papers</p>
<p>In this step, it is crucial to have a repository where you can store all the papers you are reading and have version control available. Zotero is an incredible tool because, in addition to being open-source, it allows you to export references in a .bib file and synchronize it with other software such as Mendeley. Additionally, it allows you to take notes and annotations on the paper itself.</p>
<p>3. Reading the paper</p>
<p>I recommend reading "How to Read a Paper" from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, 2016 (available at <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf">https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>The publication "How to Read a Paper" provides a practical guide to help readers understand and analyze scientific articles. The article suggests a number of steps to be followed when reading a paper, including identifying the research problem, reviewing the relevant literature, evaluating the methodology used, interpreting the results, and critically evaluating the work.</p>
<p>Additionally, the publication provides useful tips for maximizing reading efficiency, such as active reading, note-taking, defining vocabulary, and using additional sources to complement understanding of the topic. The importance of clear and effective communication in papers is highlighted, and authors are suggested to follow certain writing guidelines to ensure their work is accessible and understandable to readers.</p>
<p>Overall, the publication offers a complete set of tools and strategies to help readers navigate scientific papers and better understand the research presented.</p>
<p>4. Writing down the main ideas of the paper:</p>
<p>Create notes, questions, try to prioritize the ideas presented in the text. What is the big picture? And finally, how can said paper contribute to the literature review you are conducting?</p>
